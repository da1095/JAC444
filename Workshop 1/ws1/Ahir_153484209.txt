TASK 1
For task 1, as there was a 2 dimension array, I used 2 for loops, one for row and other for the column. So each time I had
to do something with that array, 2 ofr loops were used. As we needed to find the maximum number in the array, I created a method name
MaxValue. This method was created just to find the maximum number. I did this by using 2 for loops as I mentioned before. For for loop 
will go through the loops and the secod for loop will go to each element of columns. It will have an If condition to compare which one is 
greater than other and it will return the number as the maximum number. i created a second method which will tell me the position of that
maximum number we found in the first method. Than in the main method, I prompted the user to put a value for  row and a column. And I put
the method after the user prompt code. With this I was able to finish the task 1.


TASK 2
For task 2, a radom function was needed in order to create a radommiser for the dices. I imported the random class from the java util 
library and assigned it to both of the dice variable and added 1 to both of them, as random function starts with 0 adn bound it to 6. 
This will create the randomness the dice have in real life. Than I added both of the dices and applied a condition in a while loop. So 
I set a condition as we were asked, with this the program will keep running until the condition is met. And that is how task 2 was made.
